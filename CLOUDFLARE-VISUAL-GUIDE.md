## ⚠️ **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

### **✅ DO THIS:**
- Framework preset: **"None"** (not React/Vue/etc)
- Build command: **Leave completely empty**
- Build directory: **Just "."** (single dot)
- Use main branch (has all fixes)

### **❌ NEVER DO THIS:**
- Don't select any framework preset other than "None"
- Don't add build commands like "npm run build" 
- Don't use "./dist" or other directories
- Don't use development branches

---

## 🔧 **IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG**

### **Build Fails? Check These:**
1. **Framework**: Must be "None"
2. **Build Command**: Must be empty
3. **Output Directory**: Must be "." 
4. **Files**: Verify wrangler.toml, _headers, _redirects exist

### **Page Not Loading? Check These:**
1. **DNS**: Verify custom domain DNS settings
2. **SSL**: Wait for certificate generation (up to 10 mins)
3. **Files**: Ensure index.html is in repository root
4. **Cache**: Clear browser cache and try again

### **Payment Not Working? Check These:**
1. **JavaScript**: Check browser console for errors
2. **Stripe**: Verify Stripe initialization logs
3. **CSP**: Security headers should allow Stripe domains
4. **Course Selection**: Add course to cart first, then payment activates
