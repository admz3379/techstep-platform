# 🔧 Cloudflare Pages Deployment Troubleshooting

## 🚨 **BUILD FAILURE ISSUE - SOLVED!**

### **Problem Identified:**
```
❌ npm error Missing script: "build"
❌ Failed: build command exited with code: 1
```

### **Root Cause:**
Cloudflare Pages detected Node.js and automatically tried to run `npm run build`, but TechStep is a static HTML site that doesn't need building.

### **✅ SOLUTION APPLIED:**

1. **Updated `wrangler.toml`** - Added explicit build configuration
2. **Fixed `package.json`** - Added dummy build script that exits successfully
3. **Added `.nvmrc`** - Prevents Node.js detection issues
4. **Created `build.sh`** - Fallback build script for static sites

---

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE FIX ACTIONS:**

### **Option 1: Update Cloudflare Dashboard Settings** (Recommended)
1. **Go to your Cloudflare Pages project**
2. **Settings** → **Builds & deployments** 
3. **Click "Edit configuration"**
4. **Set these EXACT values:**
   ```
   Framework preset: None
   Build command: (DELETE any text - leave completely empty)
   Build output directory: .
   Root directory: (leave empty)
   Node.js version: 18 (or leave default)
   ```
5. **Save configuration**
6. **Retry deployment**

### **Option 2: Use Latest Repository (Recommended)**
The repository now contains all fixes:
1. **Pull latest changes** from main branch
2. **Redeploy** - Cloudflare will use the updated configuration
3. **The build should now succeed**

## 🎯 **STEP-BY-STEP RESOLUTION:**

### **STEP 1: Access Your Project Settings**
```
🌐 Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → Your Project
⚙️ Click "Settings" tab
🔧 Click "Builds & deployments"
✏️ Click "Edit configuration"
```

### **STEP 2: Clear Build Configuration**
```
❌ DELETE any build command text
❌ Framework should be "None" 
❌ Root directory should be empty
✅ Build output directory should be "."
```

### **STEP 3: Verify Settings**
```
✅ Framework preset: None
✅ Build command: (completely empty)
✅ Build output directory: .
✅ Root directory: (empty)
```

### **STEP 4: Retry Deployment**
```
🚀 Click "Save and Deploy"
⏳ Wait for new deployment (2-3 minutes)
🎉 Should complete successfully now
```

---

## 🔍 **VERIFICATION STEPS:**

### **Check Deployment Logs Should Show:**
```
✅ Cloning repository... SUCCESS
✅ No wrangler.toml build command OR build script runs successfully
✅ Success: Finished building
✅ Deployment complete
```

### **Test Live Site Should Have:**
```
✅ Page loads without errors
✅ Course dropdown menus work
✅ "Add to Cart" buttons trigger payment section
✅ Stripe integration functional
✅ Mobile responsive design
```

---

## 🆘 **OTHER COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:**

### **Issue: "Framework Detection Failed"**
**Solution:**
- Set Framework preset to "None" explicitly
- Clear any auto-detected framework settings

### **Issue: "Build Output Not Found"**
**Solution:**
- Set Build output directory to "." (single dot)
- Don't use "/dist" or other folders

### **Issue: "SSL Certificate Errors"**
**Solution:**
- Wait 5-10 minutes for certificate generation
- Ensure DNS settings are correct
- Try accessing via HTTPS (not HTTP)

### **Issue: "404 Not Found"**
**Solution:**
- Verify `index.html` exists in repository root
- Check that `_redirects` file is present
- Ensure build output directory is "."

### **Issue: "JavaScript/Stripe Errors"**
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for specific errors
- Verify `_headers` file includes CSP for Stripe
- Ensure course is added to cart before payment
