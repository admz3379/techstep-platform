# 🎯 Media Integration Instructions

## ✅ Your Media Has Been Integrated!

I've safely added your uploaded media to the platform:

### 📸 **Your Image** - Top/Hero Section
- **Location**: Hero section background
- **Effect**: Subtle background overlay with blur effect
- **Fallback**: Hidden if file not found (won't break layout)

### 🎥 **Your Video** - Podcast Section  
- **Location**: Featured content in podcast section
- **Effect**: Full-width video player with custom styling
- **Fallback**: Shows placeholder if file not found

## 🔧 **How to Update with Your Real Filenames**

### Step 1: Find Your Uploaded Files
Go to your GitHub repo and note the exact filenames:
- Image: `media/images/backgrounds/YOUR-IMAGE-NAME.jpg`
- Video: `media/videos/courses/YOUR-VIDEO-NAME.mp4`

### Step 2: Update the Code (2 simple changes)

**For Your Image (Line ~670 in index.html):**
```html
<!-- Change this line: -->
<img src="media/images/backgrounds/your-image-name.jpg" 

<!-- To this (with your real filename): -->
<img src="media/images/backgrounds/YOUR-ACTUAL-FILENAME.jpg"
```

**For Your Video (Line ~1060 in index.html):**
```html
<!-- Change this line: -->
<source src="media/videos/courses/your-video-name.mp4" type="video/mp4">

<!-- To this (with your real filename): -->
<source src="media/videos/courses/YOUR-ACTUAL-FILENAME.mp4" type="video/mp4">
```
